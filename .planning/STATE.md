# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** A reliable, maintainable codebase that real users can depend on: secure by default, easy to extend, and observable when things go wrong.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Security Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Security Hardening)
Plan: 1 of TBD in current phase (01-01 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-13 — Plan 01-01 complete; REACH_SECRET and localhost URLs removed from extension and web

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project init: Keep SQLite (schema fixes + indices give most benefit without infra change)
- Project init: JS not TS (TypeScript migration would dominate refactor time)
- Project init: Zod for validation (already used in emailFinder.js; consistent pattern)
- Project init: Split by concern not file size (decompose on responsibility boundaries)
- 01-01: Kept GET_RUNTIME_CONFIG message type to match existing callers in panel.js, sidebar.js, popup.js
- 01-01: DEFAULT_CONFIG fallback in panel.js/sidebar.js is acceptable (localhost defaults, not secrets)
- 01-01: web/.env gitignored via .env.* rule; web/.env.example committed as template
- [Phase 01-02]: chrome-extension:// origins checked via startsWith() in code, not listed literally in ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- [Phase 01-02]: requireSecret returns 500 when REACH_SECRET env var absent (server misconfiguration), 401 on mismatch
- [Phase 01-02]: requireSecret applied globally via app.use('/api', requireSecret) before route definitions to prevent future routes missing auth

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- REACH_SECRET was compromised (hardcoded in background.js); 01-01 removed it — user must run generate-secret and set a new value in extension/config.js
- Extension module splitting (Phase 4) must preserve Manifest V3 compliance; all new modules need explicit manifest permissions if they access chrome APIs
